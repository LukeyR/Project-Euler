# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is
# 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
#
# No input

# Maximum number from 2 x 3-digit numbers is 999*999
# As we want largest palindrome, count down, starting from 999*999, 999*998, ... , 998*998, 998*997, ... , 100*100
